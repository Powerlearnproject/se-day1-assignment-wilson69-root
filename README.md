Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic application of engineering principles, tools and methods to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.Its importance to the industry is that it enables creation of software and applications that power varous aspects of our modern lives like communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Structured Programming=>Was popular in the mid-1960s, introduced control flow and program organization techniques, and, allowed programs to be modularized, readable, and, maintanable.
Object-oriented Programming=>Was popular in 1970s and 1980s, Developed the concept of objects encapsulating data and behavior and led to the development of large-scale complex software systems.
Agile Programming=>From 1900s to present, emphasizes iterative development,customer feedback and continuous improvement, it also introduces sprint planning, scrum meeting and test-driven development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design- creating high-level and detailed designs of the software archtecture
Implementation- writing code and bulding the software according to design.
Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment - Releasing the software to the clients
Maintenace - providing support updates and enhancements



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodlogy is a sequential approach with distinct phases and each must be completed before moving on to the next for example a project with strict regulatory requirements like aerospace and defense kind of projects  WHILE Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexiblity, collaboration, and responding to change examples of applications are projects with evolving requirements and complex requirements 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer roles and responsibilities include: Designing and developing software, problem-solving, testing and debugging, collaboraton, learning and adaptation and documentation
A Quality Assurance Engineer roles and responsibilities include: understanding requirements, Test planning and design, Test execution, Defect Tracking and Reporting.
A Project Manager roles and responsiblities include: Project initiation, Project plannng, Resource management, risk management and communication management.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated environments offer a cetralized workspace, enhanced code editing, efficient build autmation and intergrated testing examples of IDEs are visual studio, pycharm, and eclipse.
Version Control Systems(VCS) come in handy in software development process as the help in tracking changes, collaboration, branching and merging and backup and recovery an example of a Version control system is GIT, Subversion and Mercurial.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping up with technology - the strategy to this is to keep learning by following blogs and industry experts
Debugging Complex issues - the strategy to this is to use debugging tools effectively, collaborations with other developers and also practice systematic debugging techniques.
Communication breakdown- the strategy is to practice active listening and use of clear and concise language
Tight deadlines - prioritize tasks, estimate accurately and break down large tasks into smaller ones



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing - testing individual components or modules of software
Intergration Testing - testng interactions between different components and subsystems
System Testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance Testng - testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engneering can be described as a set of commands or questions fed into and AI to give a desired reponse or solution, the importance of propmpt engineering is that with the right prompt you get the right answer from your AI.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Prompt_one = "generate a html code for a e-commerce website"
Prompt_two = "Generate HTML code for a product page on an e-commerce website.  The page should display a single product with the following information: a large product image, product title, price, a brief description, a dropdown menu for selecting size (S, M, L), a button to add the product to the cart, and customer reviews (at least 3, with author and rating).  The HTML should be well-structured and include basic CSS styling for layout and appearance.  Assume the image is located at 'images/product.jpg'.  Do not include any JavaScript."
The second prompt is more specified than the first one, it as also concise as it avoids use of jargon and also has clear requirements compared to the first one.
